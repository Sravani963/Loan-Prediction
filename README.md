#1. Introduction

In this kernel, we are exploring classification problem using loan prediction data from start to finish. After exploring data by Exploratory data analysis, we are going to test various Machine learning algorithm.

Let's begin then!!

#2. Problem Statement

About Company Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.

Problem Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others.

It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s).

Evaluation Metric is accuracy i.e. percentage of loan approval you correctly predict.
